# cs-data-structures
Data structures are fundamental for a software engineer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how one could implement common data structures using nothing more than .Net Core framework installed on a local machine besides Nuget packages such as: XUnit and FluentAssertions which are used for testing purpose.
# Contribution
This repository is contribution friendly. If you'd like to add or improve an anything, you are welcome. Feel free to work on your own and then simply make a pull request.
# Running
To run this whole example you will first of all need to install .Net Core which is avilable at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download  
Additionaly project with test is using XUnit and FluentAssertions.  
Originally it was written and compiled on macOS Catalina using .Net Core 2.2.2.
